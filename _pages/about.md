<p style="text-align: justify;"> I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering (SSIE) at the Binghamton University and expected to graduate at the end of may, 2023. <strong>My resume can be found <a href='assets/pdf/Industrial_Resume.pdf'>Here</a>.</strong>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Research: </strong> I'm interested in Bayesian deep learning and Gaussian process with its variations, e.g., sparse Gaussian process, deep Gaussian process, Gaussian process latent variable model and conditional density estimation. One of my main application is active learning. 

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Current Work: </strong>I'm working with my advisor <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/ssie/people/profile.html?id=ccheng">Dr. Changqing Cheng</a> on the combination of Bayesian framework and physics-informed neural network (PINN). Also, I'm currently learning Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, especially diffusion model. 

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>I'm actively seeking opportunities as Machine Learning (Research) Engineer.</strong>
