I'm currently PhD candidate in the Department of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering (SSIE) at Binghamton University. My research interests lie in Machine Learning/Deep Learning with special focus on probabilistic model, e.g., Gaussian process, active learning and self-supervised learning. My CV can be found [here](assets/pdf/Industrial_Resume.pdf).
