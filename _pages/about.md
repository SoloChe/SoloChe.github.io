<p style="text-align: justify;"> I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in  <a href="https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/wulab/">Wu Lab</a> at ASU, advised by <a href="https://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/twu/" target="_blank">Dr. Teresa Wu</a>. <strong>My resume can be found <a href='../assets/Resume_Latex/Resume.pdf'>Here</a>.</strong> Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Systems Science from Binghamton University, advised by <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/ssie/people/profile.html?id=ccheng" target="_blank">Dr. Changqing Cheng</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Research: </strong> I'm currently interested in generative model, e.g., medical imaging with diffusion models and vision autoregressive models, Bayesian deep learning, Gaussian process. 

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Current Work: </strong>
<ul>
<li> Unsupervised and weakly supervised anomaly detection/segmentation </li>
<li> Multi-modality models for traumatic brain injury diagnosis </li>
<li> Harmonizing FBP and PiB tracer in amyloid PET images using Cycle-GAN </li>
</ul>
