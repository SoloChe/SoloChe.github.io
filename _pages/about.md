<p style="text-align: justify;"> I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering (SSIE) at the Binghamton University and expected to graduate Fall 2022 or Spring 2023. My research interests lie in Machine Learning, (Bayesian) Deep Learning with special focus on probabilistic model, e.g., (sparse) Gaussian process, deep Gaussian process, Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM), conditional density estimation (e.g., VAE) and active learning. I'm currently working on combination of Bayesian framework and physical-informed neural network (PINN). Also, I'm currently learning Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision for personal interests. My CV can be found <a href='assets/pdf/Industrial_Resume.pdf'>Here</a>. 

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>I'm actively seeking opportunities as Machine Learning Engineer.</strong>
